This is the second project that I've undertaken as a beginner programmer, but it is the first one that I've properly built
The first project was just fooling about in a json file of about 650 lines, so I had almost no idea what was going on (and I still kinda don't)
I'm learning to program because I think that it's cool (and I'm a nerd and think computers and robots and games and stuff are cool), though, if you're reading this, you're just as much, if not more, a nerd than I

Anyway, this repository contains all versions, past and present, of the simple clicker game
Though, everything up to v4 and part of v4 weren't done on or through github because I didn't use it yet, though I did use VSCode
