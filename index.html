        <h1>This page is dedicated to documenting my programming journey.</h1>
        <p>The below list of links, when clicked on, will bring you to the apropriate version of my simple clicker game. Usually, I created a new version when I added a significant enough change, ability or functionality, whether in the code or on the screen</p>
    </div>
    <nav>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="clicker_v1.html">V1</a></li>
            <li><a href="clicker_v2.html">V2</a></li>
            <li><a href="clicker_v3.html">V3</a></li>
            <li><a href="clicker_v4.html">V4   non-functional (i have no idea why)</a></li>
            <li><a href="clicker_v5.html">V5</a></li>
        </ul>
    </nav>
    <div>
        <p>The link at the very bottom should be the most recent version. Also, I (will have) to go back and change the older versions so that you can actually back out of it and come back to this page, so they won't be purely the same code as when I wrote them.</p>
